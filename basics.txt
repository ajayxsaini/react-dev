Virtual DOM: What does create root does?
createRoot, creates a tree like structure of the DOM and then compares it with the real DOM and if there are any differences, then it updates 
it in the DOM.
Browser basically remove the entire DOM and then then repaints the entire page with the updated DOM, that is known as reloading.
